# Snake Game

This is a simple Snake game implemented in C++.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) to control the direction of the snake.
- Try to eat as many fruits (`F`) as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
- Each time the snake eats a fruit, its length increases, and your score increases.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or its own body.
- Press `x` to exit the game.

## Controls

- `↑` - Move the snake upwards.
- `↓` - Move the snake downwards.
- `←` - Move the snake left.
- `→` - Move the snake right.
- `x` - Exit the game.

## Dependencies

- `iostream`: Standard input/output stream for console I/O.
- `conio.h`: Provides functions for non-blocking keyboard input.
- `cstdlib`: Provides functions for random number generation.
- `ctime`: Provides functions for getting the current time for seeding the random number generator.
- `thread`: Provides utilities for working with threads.

## Building and Running

To compile the game, use a C++ compiler. For example, with `g++`, you can use the following command:

```bash
g++ SnakeGame.cpp -o SnakeGame
```

## Run the game
```bash
./SnakeGame
```
## To exit the game, press 'x' and then Enter
